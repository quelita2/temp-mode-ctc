# Timers on ATmega328p

Designing a program that uses a timer in CTC mode to blink an LED every 1 second, i.e., the LED stays on for one second and off for one second, we will explore the timer functionality on the ATmega328p.

## 🤖 Settings

## Implementation in C

## 🔬 Prática Laboratorial

In laboratory practice we work on analyzing the generation of signals using the timer, in the practical and basic example of turning on an LED. See our results by accessing [link]().
